Final project for CSC412

 /*-------------------------------------------------------------------------+
 |	Final Project CSC412 - Spring 2023										|
 |	A graphic front end for a box-pushing simulation.						|
 |																			|
 |	This application simply creates a glut window with a pane to display	|
 |	a colored grid and the other to display some state information.			|
 |	Sets up callback functions to handle menu, mouse and keyboard events.	|
 |	Normally, you shouldn't have to touch anything in this code, unless		|
 |	you want to change some of the things displayed, add menus, etc.		|
 |	Only mess with this after everything else works and making a backup		|
 |	copy of your project.  OpenGL & glut are tricky and it's really easy	|
 |	to break everything with a single line of code.							|
